# Optimization & Testing Report

## Frigate Backend Testing
I have run Python unittests locally using `python3 -m unittest discover frigate/test`.

Issues identified:
1. Pydantic validation error (`Input tag 'cpu' found using 'type' does not match any of the expected tags`). `DetectorConfig` expects specific tags like `axengine, deepstack, openvino, tensorrt, etc`. Need to update configuration or testing dependencies to include `cpu` model validation schema.
2. Labelmap not found. `DetectorConfig` attempts to load `/labelmap.txt` but it is not available.
3. Test failure in `test_ffmpeg_presets.py`. A failure on `test_gpu_arg_formatting` related to `vaapi` argument. Ensure tests are executed in environment with properly loaded `/usr/lib/ffmpeg/ffmpeg`.

## Frontend Testing
The Vitest tests were run correctly with `npx vitest run src/`.
All 93 Vitest unit tests passed successfully without matching `e2e` Playwright test files.

## Documentation
Documentation has been updated with detailed findings on errors, issues to test against, and vitest command formatting.

All 93 Vitest unit tests passed successfully without matching `e2e` Playwright test files.
I replaced the `it` import/declaration inside `web/src/lib/__tests__/formatTimeAgo.test.ts` to `test` since Vitest/Mocha doesn't resolve it properly in Github actions environment without additional types.

### Backend Testing Updates (test_runner.py mocks)
I have run Python unittests locally using `python3 test_runner.py` and identified further test mock failures.
The mocks for `BaseModel` and `unidecode` were incomplete.
- We fixed the `BaseModel` mock to include an `__init__` constructor that accepts `**kwargs`.
- We fixed the `unidecode` mock to map accented characters to non-accented ones.

## General Testing Report - 2026-08-27 00:27:11

* **Backend Issues:** Local tests fallback via `test_runner.py` is brittle and fails consistently on Pydantic v2 validation errors (e.g., `MockPydanticValidationError not raised`) and mocked CV/Numpy shape assertions. Docker execution fails due to `overlayfs` mount issues.
* **Rust Warnings:** `frigate-detector-rs`, `frigate-motion-rs`, and `frigate-yolo-rs` exhibit `dead_code` and `unused_mut` compiler warnings.
* **Frontend Setup:** Vitest runs smoothly, however, node processes emit repeated `punycode` deprecation warnings due to internal/dependency usage.

### Optimization Focus for Future Sprints
1. **Docker Environment Reliability:** Configure the CI/CD and Makefile to avoid standard cache issues during `docker buildx build`.
2. **Local Dev Environment:** Move away from manual `sys.modules` overriding for core logic; adopt native virtualenvs.
3. **Rust Build Strictness:** Compile the Rust workspaces with `#![deny(warnings)]` or run `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` to enforce code cleanliness.
