# Optimization & Testing Report

## Frigate Backend Testing
I have run Python unittests locally using `python3 -m unittest discover frigate/test`.

Issues identified:
1. Pydantic validation error (`Input tag 'cpu' found using 'type' does not match any of the expected tags`). `DetectorConfig` expects specific tags like `axengine, deepstack, openvino, tensorrt, etc`. Need to update configuration or testing dependencies to include `cpu` model validation schema.
2. Labelmap not found. `DetectorConfig` attempts to load `/labelmap.txt` but it is not available.
3. Test failure in `test_ffmpeg_presets.py`. A failure on `test_gpu_arg_formatting` related to `vaapi` argument. Ensure tests are executed in environment with properly loaded `/usr/lib/ffmpeg/ffmpeg`.

## Frontend Testing
The Vitest tests were run correctly with `npx vitest run src/`.
All 93 Vitest unit tests passed successfully without matching `e2e` Playwright test files.

## Documentation
Documentation has been updated with detailed findings on errors, issues to test against, and vitest command formatting.

All 93 Vitest unit tests passed successfully without matching `e2e` Playwright test files.
I replaced the `it` import/declaration inside `web/src/lib/__tests__/formatTimeAgo.test.ts` to `test` since Vitest/Mocha doesn't resolve it properly in Github actions environment without additional types.

### Backend Testing Updates (test_runner.py mocks)
I have run Python unittests locally using `python3 test_runner.py` and identified further test mock failures.
The mocks for `BaseModel` and `unidecode` were incomplete.
- We fixed the `BaseModel` mock to include an `__init__` constructor that accepts `**kwargs`.
- We fixed the `unidecode` mock to map accented characters to non-accented ones.

## Most Recent Optimization & Issues Report Update

### Rust Crates Verification
We validated the Rust logic implementation by running `cargo test` within `frigate-detector-rs`, `frigate-frame-rs`, `frigate-motion-rs`, and `frigate-yolo-rs`.
**Status**: All 26 Rust tests pass.
**Optimization Opportunities (Rust)**:
- In `frigate-detector-rs`, `Shutdown` enum variant is never constructed.
- In `frigate-motion-rs`, there are unnecessary `mut` bindings for variables (e.g. `avg = vec![100.0f32; len]`) and unused functions like `not_a_test_debug_step_by_step`.
- In `frigate-yolo-rs`, `AF_STRIDES` constant and `make_grid_points` function are unused.
- **Recommendation**: Run `cargo fix --lib --tests` and resolve dead code warnings to maintain a pristine codebase.

### Frontend and Backend Verification
- Frontend Vitest suite is highly stable when scoped to `src/`. All 138 tests run in `< 6s`.
- Node deprecation warning `[DEP0040]` for `punycode` is still spammed in CI logs; dependencies should be updated to address this.
- Native backend tests (`test_runner.py`) generate significant failures due to the `sys.modules` strategy failing to replicate `pydantic` structure and `cv2` bindings.
- Docker execution (`make run_tests`) continues to fail at the build phase due to the host `overlayfs` limitation.
