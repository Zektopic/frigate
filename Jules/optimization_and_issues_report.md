# Optimization & Testing Report

## Frigate Backend Testing
I have run Python unittests locally using `python3 -m unittest discover frigate/test`.

Issues identified:
1. Pydantic validation error (`Input tag 'cpu' found using 'type' does not match any of the expected tags`). `DetectorConfig` expects specific tags like `axengine, deepstack, openvino, tensorrt, etc`. Need to update configuration or testing dependencies to include `cpu` model validation schema.
2. Labelmap not found. `DetectorConfig` attempts to load `/labelmap.txt` but it is not available.
3. Test failure in `test_ffmpeg_presets.py`. A failure on `test_gpu_arg_formatting` related to `vaapi` argument. Ensure tests are executed in environment with properly loaded `/usr/lib/ffmpeg/ffmpeg`.

## Frontend Testing
The Vitest tests were run correctly with `npx vitest run src/`.
All 93 Vitest unit tests passed successfully without matching `e2e` Playwright test files.

## Documentation
Documentation has been updated with detailed findings on errors, issues to test against, and vitest command formatting.

All 93 Vitest unit tests passed successfully without matching `e2e` Playwright test files.
I replaced the `it` import/declaration inside `web/src/lib/__tests__/formatTimeAgo.test.ts` to `test` since Vitest/Mocha doesn't resolve it properly in Github actions environment without additional types.
