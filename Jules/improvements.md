# Future Improvements and Features
## Authentication and Security
- Implement password strength validation for new passwords.
- Consider adding rate limiting on login endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks.

## Optimizations
- Add incremental vacuuming configuration to SQLite instead of full to reduce wear on flash memory.
- Reduce frequency of background processes on low-core APUs.
- Investigate using zero-copy reading in the ffmpeg video ingestion loop.

## Frontend
- Verify input validation across all config forms.

## Backend Testing
- Test suite fails to run because dependencies mock in `test_runner.py` is incomplete. Should mock additional modules such as `peewee`, `playhouse`, `unidecode`, `filelock`, `fastapi`, `httpx`, `peewee_migrate`, `pytz`, `scipy`, `sherpa_onnx`, `zeep`, `norfair.camera_motion`, `onvif`, and some missing `pydantic` fields to fix 65 failing tests.
- Backend tests also face TypeErrors during image processing. For example, `test_crop_yuv` throws `< not supported between instances of int and MagicMock` because it's using mocked cv2 methods where mock isn't sufficient.
- Python 3.12 compatibility issues inside `test_runner.py` mocks cause Pydantic to throw `TypeError: FrigateConfig() takes no arguments`.

## Backend Testing Mocks Improvements
- `unidecode` needs a specific lambda mock mapping (replacing accented characters with non-accented ones like `é` -> `e`, `á` -> `a`).
- `BaseModel` requires an `__init__` constructor accepting `**kwargs`.
